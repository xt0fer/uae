This is the source code for Anthony's Editor as downloaded from

http://sites.google.com/site/texteditors/Home/files/Anthonys_Editor.zip

The editor is interesting as it is only 2177 lines of code and
can be configured to emulate basic Emacs and Vi key bindings through a
config file.

The main limitations are that only one file can be edited at a time and there is no search and replace.
